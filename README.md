# Spring Boot + Netty

# Description

The repository is a **high**-performance tech stack based on [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) 
that using [Netty](https://netty.io/) instead of Spring Web MVC / Spring Webflux.

### Overview

![Diagram](docs/performance-diagram.png)

So, this stack in 2.8 times faster than Undertow and Webflux and in 3.18 times faster than Tomcat.

The difference in rates becomes higher with more performance hardware.
